# hello-world


Hello, everyone!

I will be a worldwide engineer. 
Now I am just one of many students. My major is biology, not even an information science major.
I go to University of Tokyo and study cell science.
But I will work as an system engineer.

I was in computer club at junior & high school.
I can read and write some computer languages, for example C++, python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, R, and so on.
I'm also trying my hand to competition programming.

I want some ideas to share with you someday here.
Please wait for me just a time.
